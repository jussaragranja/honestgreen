## Business rules

These rules are the specification. Code and tests must follow them.

### 1. Discounts
- Discounts are percentages between 0 and 100.
- The discounted amount is rounded to cents using **round half up**
  (e.g. `149.985` becomes `149.99`).

### 2. Pagination
- Pages are **1-based**: page 1 contains items 1–10, page 2 items 11–20, and so on.
- The default page size is 10.
- A page beyond the last item returns an empty list.
- A page number lower than 1 is invalid.

### 3. Shipping
- Standard shipping costs **R$ 15.00**.
- Standard shipping is **free for subtotals of R$ 200.00 or more** (inclusive).
- Express shipping costs **R$ 35.00** and is never free.

### 4. Coupons
- An unknown coupon code is rejected with error `COUPON_NOT_FOUND`.
- A coupon is valid **up to and including** its expiration date.
- After the expiration date, the coupon is rejected with error `COUPON_EXPIRED`.

### 5. Loyalty points
- The loyalty points rule is under discussion with the product team
  (PRODUCT-42) and has not been specified yet.
